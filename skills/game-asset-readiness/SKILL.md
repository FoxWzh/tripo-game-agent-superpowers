# Game Asset Readiness

Use this skill after production. This is the quality gate that decides whether the asset is engine-ready, needs repair, or should be delivered with a downgraded scope.

All inspection, repair, fallback, import, export, and packaging steps are `[MOCK]` in this portfolio.

## Input

Production Result from `game-asset-production`.

## Output: Readiness Report

```json
{
  "status": "pass|repair_required|fallback_used|fail",
  "checks": [],
  "repairs": [],
  "fallbacks": [],
  "package_manifest": [],
  "user_notes": []
}
```

## Readiness Checklist

### Mesh

- Polycount within target.
- No severe non-manifold geometry.
- Normals/tangents usable.
- Retopo result matches selected tier.
- LOD generated when required.

### UV and Texture

- UV overlap below acceptable threshold.
- Required PBR maps present.
- Texture resolution matches tier.
- Material slot names are engine-readable.
- Missing maps are documented.

### Rig and Animation

- Rig exists if required.
- Humanoid mapping passes target engine requirements.
- Skeleton naming is consistent.
- Non-standard body risks are documented.

### Engine Import

- Format matches engine target.
- Unit scale is correct.
- Pivot rule is satisfied.
- Collider hint exists when needed.
- Import smoke test passes or failure is documented.

## Repair and Fallback Policy

- 4K texture timeout -> retry once -> downgrade to 2K.
- Retopo over budget -> reduce target faces -> if still unstable, deliver tri mesh with warning.
- Rig failed -> deliver no-rig version plus rig failure report.
- PBR failed -> deliver basecolor preview plus pending PBR note.
- FBX export failed -> GLB fallback plus compatibility note.
- Unity import issue -> include issue report and import workaround.

## Package Schema

### Unity Character Package

### Static Prop Package

```text

├── models/
│   └── asset_name.fbx or asset_name.glb

```

## Stop Condition

If status is `fail`, do not present the package as engine-ready. Present it as a diagnostic artifact and explain next options.
